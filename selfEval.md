# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?
    - That cleanup stuff, editing others' code is still tricky for me. I look at it, it looks fine, and I can't find anything to better in the code.
- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?
    - Note-taking is going well. I've got my colored pens and highlighters at the ready. While contextual notes are always good, I find myself using more the examples we've done in the past. And of course they're all color-coded for my highlighting.
- What are you noticing that you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?
    - I Google feverishly, but I've found more success taking a break, rubber-ducking, and bringing my troubles to the group.
